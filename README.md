# Ernő-Cube

An ongoing project inspired by Ernő Rubik's Magic Cube. Initally in Python.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. Roadmap

 1. Initally build a Rubik's cube solver in Python. 
 
    The program will have support for cube classes such as 3x3x3's, 4x4x4's and
    pyraminx with solved condition checkers for special cases such as void
    cubes.
    
    Different solver classes will allow for different algorithms. Classes for
    renderers will be used to display and animate the cube.
 
 2. Port this to C++ both as an excercise in learning more of the language and
    for increased execution speed.
    
 3. Build a robot to execute instructions generated by the solving software and
    solve a cube in the real world.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2. Environment Setup

 1. Install Python3 via [Anaconda 3.5](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) on a
    linux system.

 2. Run `source .ernoerc` in current shell. This will setup and activate a python
    environment described in `python/environment.yml`.
